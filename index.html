    <h2>Summary</h2> 
     <p>
        I am a laughable clown with an enormous frown. As a sad happy clown, my job is a delicate dance between contrasting emotions, blending laughter with a touch of melancholy. When I step into the spotlight, I wear a painted smile that hides the depth of my feelings. I am tasked with bringing joy and laughter to my audience through physical comedy, slapstick, and exaggerated gestures, all while portraying a character who carries a sense of sadness within. I am an expert At upside down eyes and stopping people from being down.
